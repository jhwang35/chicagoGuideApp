# Chicago Guide App

This app allows users to either look through a list of attractions or restaurants in the city of Chicago.

The app works through using broadcast recievers where app A1 will send the broadcast for either a list of attractions/restaurants and app A2 will serve as the reciever based on which option the user selects in A1.
The user also has the option of directly selecting the list they would like to see in A2 by pressing on the overflow menu icon and selecting an option from there.
Once the user selects a(n) attraction/location from app A2 they website of said location will appear on the righthand side.
**App A2 is meant to be used in the landscape orientation.**
